# Printf
Welcome to our project where we are writing our own version of the printf function and test code. This project has been worked on by Chris and Melvis.  

## Usage
 
To test the code, compile the code as shown below. Ideally this will be checked by the ALX checker. 

```commandline
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
```
